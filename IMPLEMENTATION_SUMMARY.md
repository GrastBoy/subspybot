### 2. Enhanced Admin Interface
- Improved stage type selection with clear descriptions and emojis
- Better user prompts asking admin which type of stage to create
- Visual indicators for different stage types
- Comprehensive error handling

### 3. Automatic Requisites Management

- Default requisites text and configuration

### 4. Configurable Stage Ordering
- Full support for custom stage ordering using `step_order` field
- Reordering functionality through existing `reorder_bank_instructions` function
- Proper step number management with `get_next_step_number`

### 5. Comprehensive Testing
- **test_stage_management.py**: Dedicated tests for new stage functionality
- **test_integration.py**: Integration tests for bot startup and UI improvements
- **demo_enhanced_stages.py**: Complete demonstration of all features
- Fixed **test_enhanced_functionality.py** with proper cleanup

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
- Enhanced `get_stage_types()` with new requisites type and improved descriptions
- Added `add_default_requisites_stage()` and `ensure_requisites_stages_for_all_banks()` functions

### Handler Updates
- **instruction_management.py**: Enhanced stage type selection and text input handling
- **admin_handlers.py**: Added new `/add_requisites` command
- **client_bot.py**: Registered new command handler

### New Files Created
- `test_stage_management.py`: Comprehensive stage management tests
- `test_integration.py`: Integration and UI tests  
- `demo_enhanced_stages.py`: Feature demonstration script

4. **✅ User data stage with configurable fields** - Enhanced existing user_data_request type
5. **✅ Final requisites stage for all banks** - New requisites_request type with auto-addition
6. **✅ Fully configurable stage ordering** - Supported through existing step_order system
7. **✅ Testing and code analysis** - Comprehensive test suite added
8. **✅ Complete bot functionality** - All tests pass, integration verified

## Usage Examples

### Adding Requisites to All Banks
```bash
/add_requisites
```

### Stage Creation Flow
1. Admin selects bank and action
2. System shows improved stage type selection with descriptions
